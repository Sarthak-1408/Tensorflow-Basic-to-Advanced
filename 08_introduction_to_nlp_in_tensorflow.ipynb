        "\n",
        "🔑 Note: Both of these types of data are often referred to as sequences (a sentence is a sequence of words). So a common term you'll come across in NLP problems is called seq2seq, in other words, finding information in one sequence to produce another sequence (e.g. converting a speech command to a sequence of text-based steps).\n",

        "Our labels are in numerical form (0 and 1) but our Tweets are in string form.\n",
        "\n",
        "> 🤔 Question: What do you think we have to do before we can use a machine learning algorithm with our text data?\n",
        "\n",
        "If you answered something along the lines of \"turn it into numbers\", you're correct. A machine learning algorithm requires its inputs to be in numerical form.\n",
        "\n",
        "In NLP, there are two main concepts for turning text into numbers:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Tokenization - A straight mapping from word or character or sub-word to a numerical value. There are three main levels of tokenization:\n",
        "  - Using word-level tokenization with the sentence \"I love TensorFlow\" might result in \"I\" being 0, \"love\" being 1 and \"TensorFlow\" being 2. In this case, every word in a sequence considered a single token.\n",
        "  - Character-level tokenization, such as converting the letters A-Z to values 1-26. In this case, every character in a sequence considered a single token.\n",
        "  - Sub-word tokenization is in between word-level and character-level tokenization. It involves breaking invidual words into smaller parts and then converting those smaller parts into numbers. For example, \"my favourite food is pineapple pizza\" might become \"my, fav, avour, rite, fo, oo, od, is, pin, ine, app, le, piz, za\". After doing this, these sub-words would then be mapped to a numerical value. In this case, every word could be considered multiple tokens.\n",
        "- Embeddings - An embedding is a representation of natural language which can be learned. Representation comes in the form of a feature vector. For example, the word \"dance\" could be represented by the 5-dimensional vector [-0.8547, 0.4559, -0.3332, 0.9877, 0.1112]. It's important to note here, the size of the feature vector is tuneable. There are two ways to use embeddings:\n",
        "  - Create your own embedding - Once your text has been turned into numbers (required for an embedding), you can put them through an embedding layer (such as tf.keras.layers.Embedding) and an embedding representation will be learned during model training.\n",
        "  - Reuse a pre-learned embedding - Many pre-trained embeddings exist online. These pre-trained embeddings have often been learned on large corpuses of text (such as all of Wikipedia) and thus have a good underlying representation of natural language. You can use a pre-trained embedding to initialize your model and fine-tune it to your own specific task."

        "> 📖 Resource: The intuition here is explained succinctly in the paper[Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Classification, ](https://aclanthology.org/W18-5408.pdf) where they state that CNNs classify text through the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "- 1-dimensional convolving filters are used as ngram detectors, each filter specializing in a closely-related family of ngrams (an ngram is a collection of n-words, for example, an ngram of 5 might result in \"hello, my name is Daniel\").\n",
